The Solid State Relays - 12Volts is one of the open hardware solid state relay
PCB of my Dragon Mobile GitHub organization with a goal to make
useful hardware with associated firmware and software for the tiny home, van
life and maker communities.

## Description

The board consist of three main electronic sections: Power In,
Control In / Power Out,
and the Solid State Relays which are divided into two banks of four output
channels.
There are two mechanical sections as well: Mounting Holes, and the
eight MOSFET Mounting Access Holes.

### Power In

The main 12 volt power source for the rest of the board enters via the
JPWR1 and optional JPWR2 XT-60PW-M connectors. Each is rated for up to 35A but
may support 40-50A loads for brief periods in practice with good cooling.
Care should be taken to not connect or disconnect the power when any outputs
are active as this may cause some arcing within the connector which will
shorten its life span. This will be especially noticable with large inductive
loads.

The two Transient-Voltage-Suppression (TVS) diodes: TVSP1 and optional TVSP2
provide protection against high voltage spikes from entering the board through
the power source. Additionally they can act as reverse polarity protection by
shorting the incorrectly wiring source and blow its fuse. Care should be taken
to ensure the 12 volt wire is properly fused.

The final part of the Power In section is the highly recommended but optional
power applied/on LED circuit. The LEDP1 should light up any time power is
connected to the board to give a quick visual indicator. Optionally the onboard
LED can be replaced by connecting an external LED via the optional JP2 pin
header. Connecting both LEDP1 and an external LED is not recommended.
By cutting the trace between the pads of JP1 the indicator circuit can be
disabled. Additionally by doing this and soldering two leads to the pads an
external switch could be used to turn the indicator on and off as needed.

#### Optional components

The board is design to supply 30-40A across all outputs without the addition
of JPWR2 and TVSP2 to save costs. For higher currents both the additional
connector and TVS should be used. It is also recommended you increase the
board copper plating to 3oz (105Î¼m). An alternative but not recommended and
more risky way to increase current capacity is by soldering some point to point
jumper wires from near the power connectors and the center lead of the output
FETs and from the output of the FETs to the leads of the output connectors.
